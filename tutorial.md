# Ubuntu Server tutorials

This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Ubuntu Server is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims.

We hope our tutorials make as few assumptions as possible and are broadly accessible to anyone with an interest in Ubuntu Server. They should also be a good place to start learning about Ubuntu Server in general, how it works, and what it's capable of.

## Core tutorial
