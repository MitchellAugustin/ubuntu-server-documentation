# Comment lines start with a hash (#) and are ignored
# Each redirect should appear on its own line
# Do not include a file extension
# Paths don't need a slash in front of them
# We are using the dirhtml builder so we need a trailing slash at the end
# The paths should match what's in the build directory
# Example:
# redirect/from redirect/to
